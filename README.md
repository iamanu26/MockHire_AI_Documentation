## 🔍 Feature Deep Dive

### 01 — 🎙️ Voice Interview Simulation

The AI acts as a real interviewer — it speaks questions aloud via speech synthesis, listens to your spoken answers through the browser's Web Speech API, and sends your response to LLaMA 3.1 to generate the next intelligent, context-aware follow-up.

- Technical & HR interview modes
- Questions tailored to **company type**, **job role**, and **experience level**
- Conversation-aware follow-ups (not random question lists)
- Session isolation — every interview starts fresh with no history bleed

---

### 02 — 📊 AI Feedback Report

After ending a session, your full conversation history is passed to LLaMA 3.1 which generates a detailed performance report — scored and written from what you *actually said*, not a generic template.

| Score Category | What's Evaluated |
|---|---|
| 💬 Communication | Clarity, structure, and coherence of answers |
| 🧘 Confidence | Assertiveness, filler words, hedging language |
| 🔧 Technical Skills | Accuracy and depth of technical responses |
| ✍️ Grammar | Language correctness and professionalism |
| ⭐ Overall | Holistic interview performance score |

> Includes a written **strengths & weaknesses summary** specific to your actual conversation.

---

### 03 — 💻 DSA Practice Module

A LeetCode-style coding environment where every session brings 3 fresh AI-generated problems. Submit your solution and get a detailed code review from the AI.

- **3 problems per session** — Easy, Medium, Hard
- **4 languages supported** — Python, C++, Java, JavaScript
- **Browser-based editor** with line numbers and tab support
- AI reviews for **correctness**, **time complexity**, **space complexity**
- **Score out of 10** per submission

---

### 04 — 🔐 User Auth & History

JWT-based authentication keeps every user's data private, persistent, and secure.

- Register & login with **bcrypt password hashing**
- **JWT access tokens** for protected endpoint security
- Full **per-user interview history** stored in SQLite
- View past session scores and feedback anytime

## 🧠 Engineering Notes

Non-obvious problems solved during development:

- **Shared agent state bug** — Two separate `InterviewAgent` instances were being created per request, causing feedback to generate against an empty conversation history. Fixed by enforcing a single shared instance per session.
- **LLaMA JSON inconsistency** — LLaMA 3.1 sometimes returns scores as `"7/10"` strings or wraps JSON in markdown fences. Built a custom parser that handles all known output formats robustly.
- **Session isolation** — Added a `/interview/start` endpoint that explicitly clears conversation history, ensuring scores always reflect the *current* interview only — never a previous session.
- **Prompt engineering for fair scoring** — Engineered explicit scoring rubrics in the system prompt to prevent the model from giving inflated scores for low-effort answers. A server-side score cap acts as a final safety net.
